        <H1> We created google in 17 bce when thesus fought the minotour to help his father save the people of his kingdom.</H1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>
            The first article on google was about that. But the story got mixed up a little as years passed so the story you are reading on google now is fake. Thesus's last name was Cailou.(the cartoon carecter) Somone forgot to include that in the story. But as it goes, that guy accidentaly forgot to change the color of his flag on a ship so things started to get bad for him. The End. It was our ancestors who came up of the ide of google. <br> But we both decide to take all the fame for ourselves and came up of the idea of publishing it to hack computers so thats how we ended up getting rich.</p>
